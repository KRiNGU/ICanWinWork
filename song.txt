Hear me from the bottom
Forged in regret, I'm the silversmith
Doomsday
You had it coming
Marching the streets with an iron fists
Obey no more in silence
The steel in our hearts will be monuments
Today they'll hear the violence
We'll rise from the dark like Lazarus

These trials make us who we are
We're motivated by the scars that we're made of
These trials make us who we are
We take our places in the dark
We take our places in the dark

The ending won't be forgotten
It's written in the stars and the hieroglyphs
Sending the lionhearted
The stones break bones, but we're venomous

These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We're motivated by the scars that we're made of
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We take our places in the dark
We take our places in the dark

Calling, calling
We've come out to play
Show me, show me a new way
Slowly, slowly, they've led you astray
Away we go now

Calling, calling
We've come out to play
Show me, show me a new way
Slowly, slowly, they've led you astray
Away we go now into the fray

These trials make us who we are
We're motivated by the scars
These trials make us who we are
We take our places in the dark
